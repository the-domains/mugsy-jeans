The number one question we get is, "How do I wash my jeans?" Most people simply put their jeans through the washer and dryer with their other clothes. What they don't realize is that this damages the jeans and shortens their lifespan. This is especially true for "raw denim" jeans like Mugsy's, which basically means they've never been washed or treated.

You should always take certain measures to maintain your raw denim jeans. The maintenance may seem slightly annoying at first, but since you'll be washing your jeans less than you do your normal jeans, you save time in the long-run. Plus, your wallet and admirers will thank you.

Here's what you need to know...

# **HOW TO WASH YOUR JEANS**

When it comes to washing your jeans, here are our rules of thumb:

* Wash your jeans as little as possible (we've gone up to a year without washing our jeans and even then it wasn't necessary).
* Don't wash them for the first several months. Give them time to properly break in.
* When you do wash them: Turn them inside out, put them in the washer on a cold, gentle cycle with a small amount of detergent or white vinegar.
* For an alternative method to washing in the washer, especially for black jeans, see proper jeans maintenance section below.

## **HOW TO DRY YOUR JEANS**

Always hang dry your jeans. If you want to freshen your jeans up a bit, put them in the dryer on "air only" mode with a dryer sheet. But never put your jeans in the dryer with heat! Ever. Unless you want your jeans to turn out like this:

## HOW TO PREVENT DYE BLEEDING

Because raw denim bleeds more at first, avoid sitting on light-colored furniture and clothing for the first several wears. If you're worried about the bleeding or it starts to bother you, try the following:

* Turn your jeans inside out, put them in the washer on a cold, gentle cycle with one cup of white vinegar.
* You can even try soaking them in cold water with a cup of white vinegar for 20 minutes. The vinegar helps lock in the dye.
* Always hang dry.

## **PROPER JEANS MAINTENANCE (ALTERNATIVE WASHING METHOD)**

Washing your jeans will fade the dye, especially for black jeans. To prevent fading and as an alternative to washing your jeans in the washer, do this:

* Put your jeans in the freezer overnight to kill bacteria.
* Put your jeans in the dryer on "air only" mode (no heat!) with a dryer sheet to freshen them up.
* Always hang dry.
